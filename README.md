## Maniac Geek : A fast and responsive theme for Hugo

Based on the Robust Theme (https://github.com/dim0627/hugo_theme_robust) by Daisuke Tsuji.

In the PageSpeed Insight tool of Google, a page with no image will score a 100/100 for Desktop and Mobile. (https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/)

Some changes :

* Replace the bootstrap framework by PocketGrid
* Add a full-width page with no sidebar template for single.html (Use by défining a type="full" in the archetype of your post)
* Provide a minify CSS file
